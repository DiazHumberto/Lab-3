# Foundations of Data Science

Here are the code to execute the Lab Exercise number 2.

````pyhton
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas import read_csv
from pandas import read_csv
````

The Lab Exercise #2 introduces the fundamental Python libraries for data science: NumPy,
 SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These importants libraries give powerful tools for
 numerical computing, scientific computing, and visualization of data. By managing these
 packages, one can efficiently analyze and visualize data, making them essential for data
 science.

 NumPy, is the core library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for
 multidimensional arrays and a wide range of mathematical operations on these arrays.
 Based on NumPy, SciPy gives a higher functionality for scientific and engineering
 applications, extending its capabilities to more complex computations. For data
 visualization, Matplotlib is used as a powerful library for creating 2D plots and
 visualizations, enabling people to generate detailed and customizable graphs. Alongside
 Matplotlib, Seaborn gives a high level interface for creating statistical graphics, making it
 easier to produce visually appealing and informative plots for data analysis. All of these
 libraries form a strong toolkit for numerical computing, scientific analysis, and data
 visualization in Python.

 ````bash
pip install foobar
